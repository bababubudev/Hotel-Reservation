# Hotel Reservation


## Introduction
Welcome to my attempt at the final programming task. In my hotel reservation app, a user can select between 4 different features, giving the user comprehensive control over booking a hotel room. A user can book, check, and cancel their reservations. A feature to quit the program is also available in any point of the time. Additionally, instructions on how the parts of the program work is stated to help user navigate the program. I am hoping for a full 5 grades from this assignment as I have given very high attention to detail trying to cover bugs and quality of life features for the user.

## Features in detail
#### _[ Reserve a room ]_

- Selects a room from a list of available ones and books it for the user, while asking them name, preferred room type, and the period of stay

- Selects the amount of discount randomly (10%, 20% or 30%) and calculates the cost accordingly.

- Finally displays all information regarding the booking to the user.

#### _[ Your reservation ]_

 - Asks for either room id given to the user after booking a room, or userâ€™s name to again display all the rooms booked by the user with the name.

#### _[ Cancel reservation ]_

- As the name suggests, cancels the reservations of user or of specific room ID.

- If multiple reservations are found from a same user asks which one from the list order to cancel.

#### _[ Quit application ]_

- Simply quits the application.
